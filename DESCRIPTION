Description: BayesCOOP implements Bayesian cooperative learning for multimodal 
    data integration. The method combines jittered group spike-and-slab LASSO 
    regularization with intermediate fusion to enable robust and scalable 
    learning across multiple data modalities. For uncertainty quantification, 
    BayesCOOP applies the Bayesian bootstrap to generate approximate posterior 
    samples via maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation on jittered and resampled 
    multimodal datasets. The current version supports continuous outcomes, with 
    additional outcome types planned for future releases.
